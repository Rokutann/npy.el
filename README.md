## Synopsis

**nPipenv** is a nano (or minimalistic) support for Pipenv in Emacs. Its
goal is to provide a nice integration of Pipenv virtual environment
and Emacs inferior python mode.  For instance - spawning multiple
inferior python processes for multiple Pipenv projects, and
dispatching Python code chunks sent from a buffer, which is visiting a Python file
in one of such Pipenv projects, to the inferior python process bound to
the same Pipenv project. We call this new type of inferior python processes
**virtualenv-dedicated inferior python process**.

Some of nPipenv's features:

* spawn a virtualenv-dedicated inferior python process for a Pipenv project
* send a Python code chunk from multiple Python file buffers in a Pipenv project
  to the virtualenv-dedicated inferior python process for the project
* dispatch Python code chunks to appropriate virtualenv-dedicated inferior
  python processes when you have spawned multiple virtualenv-dedicated inferior
  python processes for different Pipenv projects
* change buffer's association to a Pipenv project automatically when
  you write out the content of the buffer as a file under other Pipenv project
* spawn a Pipenv shell for a Pipenv project

## Installation

Ensure you have two elisp packages, `f` and `s`, installed in your Emacs
prior to the nPipenv installation. You can get them from `MELPA`
or `Github`.

Place `npipenv.el` on a directory in your `load-path', and add this to
your Emacs config:

```el
(require 'npipenv)
(npipenv-initialize)
```

The initial keymap prefix "C-c '" is just a suggestion. Feel free to
customize `npipenv-keymap-prefix` to whatever works best for you.

### Basic Usage

`nPipenv-mode` is automatically enabled when you open a Python file, i.e.
it's hooked to the `python-mode`.

The mode line shows the Pipenv project the file the buffer visiting belongs to.
The association usually happens when you open a file. The mode line looks like
**nP[v:hello_world]** where 'hello_world' is the name of the Pipenv project.

Spawn an virtualenv-dedicated inferior python process by <kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>'</kbd>
<kbd>p</kbd> or <kbd>M-x</kbd> <kbd>npipenv-run-python</kbd>. Its buffer name should
be **\*Python[v:hello_world]\***.

After that npipenv-mode works transparently: you can use all the
interaction between the source file(s) and the inferior python mode as
in `python-mode`.

Additionally, you can spawn a buffer-dedicated inferior python mode
with access to the virtual environment by putting any prefix args to
<kbd>M-x</kbd> <kbd>npipenv-run-python</kbd> or <kbd>C-u</kbd>
<kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>'</kbd> <kbd>p</kbd>. The mode lines look like
**nP[v:hello_world;b:hello.py]** and
**\*Python[v:hello_world;b:hello.py]\***.  The inferior python process
only belongs to the buffer. Other buffers from the same Pipenv can't
send code chunks to the process.

Note: The `python-mode` defines two types of inferior python
processes: global and (buffer-)dedicated. Their precedence order
'dedicated first':

```
buffer-dedicated > global
```

nPipenv introduces two additional types: virtualenv-dedicated and
virtualenv-buffer-dedicated. The precedence order is:

```
virtualenv-buffer-dedicated > virtualenv-dedicated > buffer-dedicated > global
```

We might change this in a future release.

If you need to update the association between a buffer and a
virtual environment, use the command <kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>'</kbd> <kbd>v</kbd> or <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<kbd>npipenv-update-pipenv-virtualenv-root</kbd>.

You can change the Pipenv project detection method by customizing
`npipenv-pipenv-project-detection`. Its default value is `'exploring`,
which explores the directory structure bottom-up to find a
`Pipfile`. Another method is `'calling`, which calls `pipenv --where`
command. `'calling` is the surest but slower.

Spawn a Pipenv shell by <kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>'</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<kbd>npipenv-shell</kbd>.

## Caveats

* It slows down your Emacs startup process when you restore lots of
  Python files with desktop-mode. How slow depends on the project
  detection mode: `'exploring` can be acceptable, `'calling` would be a
  disaster.
