## Synopsis

**npy.el** is a set of nano (or minimalistic) extensions to the Python development 
support in Emacs. Its first goal is to provide a nice integration
of Pipenv virtual environment and Emacs inferior python mode.  For
instance - spawning multiple inferior python processes for multiple
Pipenv projects, and dispatching Python code chunks sent from a
buffer, which is visiting a Python file in one of such Pipenv
projects, to the inferior python process bound to the virtual environment of the same Pipenv
project. We call this new type of inferior processes **virtualenv-dedicated inferior python processes**.

Some of npy.el's features:

* spawn a vienrtualenv-dedicated inferior python process for a Pipenv project
* send a Python code chunk from multiple Python file buffers in a Pipenv project
  to the virtualenv-dedicated inferior python process for the project
* dispatch Python code chunks to appropriate virtualenv-dedicated inferior
  python processes when you have spawned multiple virtualenv-dedicated inferior
  python processes for different Pipenv projects
* change buffer's association to a Pipenv project automatically when
  you write out the content of the buffer as a file under other Pipenv project
* spawn a Pipenv shell for a Pipenv project

## Installation

Ensure you have two elisp packages, `f` and `s`, installed in your Emacs
prior to the npy.el installation. You can get them from `MELPA`
or `Github`.

Place `npy.el` on a directory in your `load-path', and add this to
your Emacs config:

```el
(require 'npy)
(npy-initialize)
```

The initial keymap prefix "C-c '" is just a suggestion. Feel free to
customize `npy-keymap-prefix` to whatever works best for you.

### Basic Usage

`npy-mode` is automatically enabled when you open a Python file, i.e.
it's hooked to the `python-mode`.

The mode line shows the Pipenv project the file the buffer visiting belongs to.
The association usually happens when you open a file. The mode line looks like
**Py[v:hello_world]** where 'hello_world' is the name of the Pipenv project.

Spawn an virtualenv-dedicated inferior python process by <kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>'</kbd>
<kbd>p</kbd> or <kbd>M-x</kbd> <kbd>npy-run-python</kbd>. Its buffer name should
be **\*Python[v:hello_world]\***.

After that npy-mode works transparently: you can use all the
interaction between the source file(s) and the inferior python mode as
in `python-mode`.

Additionally, you can spawn a buffer-dedicated inferior python mode
with access to the virtual environment by putting any prefix args to
<kbd>M-x</kbd> <kbd>npy-run-python</kbd> or <kbd>C-u</kbd>
<kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>'</kbd> <kbd>p</kbd>. The mode lines look like
**Py[v:hello_world;b:hello.py]** and
**\*Python[v:hello_world;b:hello.py]\***.  The inferior python process
only belongs to the buffer. Other buffers from the same Pipenv can't
send code chunks to the process.

Note: The `python-mode` defines two types of inferior python
processes: global and (buffer-)dedicated. Their precedence order
'dedicated first':

```
buffer-dedicated > global
```

npy.el introduces two additional types: virtualenv-dedicated and
virtualenv-buffer-dedicated. The precedence order is:

```
virtualenv-buffer-dedicated > virtualenv-dedicated > buffer-dedicated > global
```

We might change this in a future release.

If you need to update the association between a buffer and a
virtual environment, use the command <kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>'</kbd> <kbd>v</kbd> or <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<kbd>npy-update-pipenv-virtualenv-root</kbd>.

You can change the Pipenv project detection method by customizing
`npy-pipenv-project-detection`. Its default value is `'exploring`,
which explores the directory structure bottom-up to find a
`Pipfile`. Another method is `'calling`, which calls `pipenv --where`
command. `'calling` is the surest but slower.

Spawn a Pipenv shell by <kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>'</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<kbd>npy-shell</kbd>.

## Caveats

* It slows down your Emacs startup process when you restore lots of
  Python files with desktop-mode. How slow depends on the project
  detection mode: `'exploring` can be acceptable, `'calling` would be a
  disaster.
